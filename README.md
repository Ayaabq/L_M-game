Logic Magnets Game:

This project is a grid-based game named Logic Magnets, developed as part of my coursework in the Search Algorithms subject at ITE-DU.

Overview:

The game involves moving pieces on a grid with specific logic and behavior for each piece, aiming to achieve designated target positions with the fewest moves. The main components of this game include a search algorithm implemented using Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the optimal solution, as well as a Pygame-based graphical interface.

Features:

Grid-based Gameplay: Players can move pieces on a grid according to specific rules and interactions.
Piece Interactions: Includes unique behaviors for pieces, such as attraction and repulsion.
Search Algorithm Solver

Requirements:
Python 3.x

About:

This project is submitted as a homework assignment for the Search Algorithm subject.
